Answer: ## Why is the Sky Blue?

The blue color of the sky is due to a phenomenon known as **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a brief explanation:

- **Light from the Sun**: Sunlight, or white light, is made up of many different colors, each with its own wavelength.
- **Atmospheric Scattering**: When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles in the air. This scattering affects the shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) more than the longer wavelengths (red and yellow).
- **Perception of Blue**: Although violet light is scattered even more than blue light, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light. Additionally, some of the violet light is absorbed by the ozone layer. As a result, we perceive the sky as blue.
