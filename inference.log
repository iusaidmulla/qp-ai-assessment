The blue color of the sky is due to a phenomenon known as **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a simplified explanation:

- **Sunlight Composition**: Sunlight, or white light, is composed of various colors, each with different wavelengths.
- **Atmosphere's Role**: When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles in the air.
- **Scattering Process**: The shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) scatter more than the longer wavelengths (red, yellow). Although violet light is scattered even more than blue light, our eyes are more sensitive to blue, and some of the violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere.
- **Perception**: As a result, we perceive the sky as blue.

This explanation is not derived from the provided context, but rather from general scientific knowledge.
